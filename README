Think to write comment when needed (when you start having trouble coding, consider it's needed)

Everyone work on his branch.

Think to commit everytime you finish something, it's easier to revert after.

Try to push after every coding sessions.

PUSH ONLY ON YOUR BRANCH.

Once your feature is enough advanced, don't merge it on the master please.. If you want to be update with the master,
use this (think to commit, ofc)

%Go back to the master
git checkout master
%pull the master
git pull
%go back to your branch
git checkout local_branch_name
%update to have the master
git rebase master


Once your feature is finished, we'll see how to integrate it :D
